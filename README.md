# Anime-Downloader

GREETINGS:

I was TIRED of downloading anime by myself on random websites, facing many ads. Fingers would hurt after closing ads that the website opened.
So, to tackle this "problem", I did what i always do - Write a silly little code for it. 
I "learned" selenium for this. With the help of Google Gemini, ChatGPT and GeeksForGeeks, I wrote this programme.
Thanks to dl.animesp.xyz and animeflix.lol , I was able to make the downloaders.
I hope this makes your anime downloading experience better!
PLUS, There will be ALMOST NO annoying ads on your screen AND this code is pretty SAFE and SECURE. No need to be afraid of viruses as long as you don't interfere with the browsers!

INTRO:

Theres are two apps, namely - AnimeDownloaderV1 and AnimeDownloaderV2. Let's call them V1 and V2 for short.
V1 works with the help of dl.animesp.xyz and is useful for batch downloading an anime.
V2 works with the help of animeflix.lol and is useful for downloading anything from an anime you want - whether it be the complete anime or a partiular season or episode.
IMPORTANT - You need Microsoft Edge downloaded for this to work. This is mainly because Edge is faster than it's competitors. IF you want, you can edit the code to use a browser of your choice.

GETTING STARTED with V1:

For V1, there is NO GUI. Also, you will have to open a browser yourself and copy a special link. Here are a few examples:
1) https://dl.animesp.xyz/Completed/Shimoneta/720/
2) https://dl.animesp.xyz/Completed/JOJO%20Part%203/720/
3) https://dl.animesp.xyz/Ongoing/Demon%20Slayer/720/
Notice a pattern? When you click any of the links in these webpages, a download starts. You will have to search for webpages like these, if you want to use V1. So, V2 is highly reccomended.
Then, click on any link and wait till a download starts. Wait till it is completed. Note the time when you first clicked start button and till now in seconds. This is your wait time.
Again, V2 is highly reccomended.
When you run the code, this special link shall be your first input and the time will be your second input.
When you press Enter, Download will get started and all the files should be in your download folder.
Plus, Do NOT intefere with the browser that V1 opens in any way.

GETTING STARTED with V2:

V2 is relatively simpler to use. Just follow the instructions on the screen and for whatever reasons do NOT click on the browser that V2 opens -  Because you will face an ad if you click it yourself.
If you do manage to click, close the new tab. I kept the browser settings like that, beacuse I wanted you guys to be able to see the results.
It should make downloading anime easier with that kind of visualization.
If you are NOT using Windows, Then when downloading from V2 don't bother to select a folder and in the "Move checkbox", uncheck it. This will prevent any errors.
Known Limitations - You can't download anime from webpages like these - https://animeflix.lol/download-dragon-ball-super-2015-dual-audio-english-japanese-hevc-720p/

AND, That's it! With this, you shall be able to download many anime, have fun!

Plus, I look forward to working with contributors. Feel free to report bugs, unexpected behaviour, etc.
